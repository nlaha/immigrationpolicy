has taken center stage in the United\n              States over the past decade. It draws a passionate argument from\n              both sides of the debate due to its significance to so many people\n              with around 14% of the U.S being foreign-born and another 12%\n              second generation. Many fear that immigration erodes our welfare\n              state and steals American jobs. While others seek the talent the\n              rest of the world has to offer. It is our position that\n              immigration would be a great benefit to all, lifting the global\n              poor from their poverty, and Americans along with them.\n            </Typography>\n          </div>\n        </Paper>\n        <Paper className=\"text-panel\">\n          <div className=\"content-margin\">\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\n              Positive Argument\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              Most experts agree that it would be beneficial to the average\n              American if many low-skill workers were allowed to enter the US\n              each year, almost all experts agree that the average citizen would\n              be better off if many high-skill workers were allowed to enter the\n              US each year. Immigrants have a large positive effect on the\n              communities they live in. Immigrants act as consumers, creating\n              more demand for small businesses, and as job creators, creating\n              more businesses in the communities they live in. Most immigrants\n              are let in through visa programs letting them work in specific job\n              areas of the US. An example of this is the H-2B program which,\n              with its mere 66,000 worker cap, fails to provide enough workers\n              to the industries that it targets.\n            </Typography>\n          </div>\n        </Paper>\n        <Paper className=\"text-panel\">\n          <div className=\"content-margin\">\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\n              Negative Argument\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              Despite immigration being one of the most contentious issues in\n              the United States, the arguments against it are some of the least\n              substantiated out there.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              The two most common fears of immigration are that it will either\n              lower American wages or steal American jobs. The claim of\n              unemployment has never been substantiated in the research. The\n              reasons for this have already been covered.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              The most popular piece of research supporting the idea that\n              immigrants reduce American wages is a{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w21588l\">study</a> by George\n              Borjas from 2015 that claimed that if you changed the methodology\n              from the famous{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w21588l\">card study</a> you\n              could find a significant wage drop among high school dropouts(only\n              high school dropouts). Borjas’s methods have been intensely\n              critiqued seeing as his sample which he cut out of a large sample\n              of low-income workers consisted of only 17 people. Economist\n              Michael Clemens states that \"if we’re willing to take low-skill\n              workers in Miami and hand-pick small subsets of them, we can\n              always find small groups of workers whose wages rose during a\n              particular period and other groups whose wages fell. But at some\n              point, we're learning more about statistical artifacts than about\n              real-world events.\" meaning a sample size so small could lead one\n              to any conclusion. The predominant view of economists is that of\n              the original card study from 1990 that concluded that immigration\n              either did not affect or dramatically increased wages of native\n              workers. One should also note that Borjas’s{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article162682623.html\">\n                {\" \"}\n                main personal conclusion\n              </a>{\" \"}\n              from his own research is not that we should reduce immigration but\n              that we should attempt to remedy its side effects with tax policy.\n            </Typography>\n          </div>\n        </Paper>\n        <Paper className=\"text-panel\">\n          <div className=\"content-margin\">\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\n              H-2B Visas\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              The H-2B visa is a program made for companies who cannot fill\n              their positions with US workers. If a company cannot find a worker\n              for a specific position, they may look to H-2B work. People who\n              apply for H-2B positions are granted a temporary visa to work in\n              non-agricultural fields. These positions are typically low skill,\n              but pay above the average minimum wage. There is a cap on 66,000\n              H-2B workers each fiscal year, this cap has various exceptions,\n              but the large majority of H-2B workers do not qualify for said\n              exceptions.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              These H-2B positions are heavily regulated by the federal\n              government. There are many restrictions put in place to keep H-2B\n              workers safe, as such, positions must be certified for H-2B work.\n              Even with all of the paperwork and processing companies must do to\n              create H-2B positions, there is more demand than ever. H-2B\n              positions have been steadily increasing over the past 20 years.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              While the number of positions have been increasing, the cap of\n              66,000 H-2B visas has remained the same (with some minor\n              exceptions, see \"Yearly H-2B Certified Positions\").\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              Many US Businesses are suffering from worker shortages due to the\n              H-2B cap. Exceptions like{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/07/17/dhs-provides-relief-american-businesses-danger-suffering-irreparable-harm\">\n                Form I-129\n              </a>{\" \"}\n              do not apply to many positions and are not garunteed. Some argue\n              that increasing the H-2B cap will take jobs away from hard working\n              Americans, specifically those in lower skill jobs where H-2B\n              workers are in high demand. However, the current state of the H-2B\n              visa program prevents this from happening. H-2B work is only\n              permitted in situations where no US workers can be found for a\n              given position. On top of that, extra expenses and documentation\n              required for H-2B workers often means companies must pay more to\n              hire said workers. There is no motive for a company to hire H-2B\n              workers unless they have exhausted all other local options.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              In addition to this, the shortage of low skill American workers\n              will only become worse as years progress. Since the year 2000, the\n              percent of adults with a bachelors degree or higher has risen 8.4%\n              and this has been the trend since the 1940s, it's reasonable to\n              assume it will continue to rise. With the steady increase in\n              educational attainment, there is also a decrease in the number of\n              people looking for low skill jobs.\n            </Typography>\n          </div>\n        </Paper>\n        <Paper className=\"text-panel\">\n          <div className=\"content-margin\">\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\n              Yearly H-2B Certified Positions\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              If a job is \"certified\" it means that no US workers could be found\n              and is open for H-2B visa applicants. The H-2B visa cap was\n              increased in 2017 by former Secretary of Homeland Security, John\n              Kelly. However, this was only on an as-needed basis for businesses\n              that need H-2B workers to survive. There are also several other\n              exemptions from the H-2B cap, see page 3 of{\" \"}\n              <a href=\"https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/FY_2019_H-2B_Characteristics_Report_Signed_Dated_4.29.20.pdf\">\n                this\n              </a>{\" \"}\n              document.\n            </Typography>\n            <H2bCount />\n          </div>\n        </Paper>\n        <Paper className=\"text-panel\">\n          <div className=\"content-margin\">\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\n              H-2B Job Type\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              H-2B workers are primarily taking on lower skill jobs that don't\n              require a college degree.\n            </Typography>\n            <H2bJobType />\n            <br></br>\n            *Data from 2017\n          </div>\n        </Paper>\n        <Paper className=\"text-panel\">\n          <div className=\"content-margin\">\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\n              Racial Equity Impact\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              As more people immigrate to America, there will be several equity\n              impacts to consider. Immigrants in the workforce will help to\n              bring diversity, and the strict regulations companies must follow\n              when hiring migrant workers will ensure equal treatment (or reduce\n              the likelihood of unequal treatment). A racially equitable\n              immigration system would provide many different options for entry\n              into the US, while still regulating company job listings. The\n              racial tensions that already exist can be lessened by diversifying\n              the workforce.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              There are some potential issues with allowing more immigrants into\n              the country, one of which is pushing already underrepresented\n              people out of the workforce. However, while this may seem like a\n              significant issue, as long as the department of labor keeps it’s\n              strict regulations on migrant work visas, simply allowing more\n              work opportunities per-year will not cause equity problems.\n            </Typography>\n          </div>\n        </Paper>\n        <Paper className=\"text-panel\">\n          <div className=\"content-margin\">\n            <Typography variant=\"h5\" gutterBottom>\n              Works Cited\n            </Typography>\n            <Typography variant=\"body1\" gutterBottom>\n              <div className=\"citation\">\n                <p>\n                  Bier, David. &ldquo;H-2B Visas: The Complex Process for\n                  Nonagricultural Employers to Hire Guest Workers.&rdquo;{\" \"}\n                  <em>Cato Institute</em>, 16 Feb. 2021,\n                  www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/h-2b-visas-complex-process-nonagricultural-employers-hire-guest-workers#introduction.\n                  Accessed 24 Mar. 2021.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Griffith, Bryan. &ldquo;Maps: Impact of H-2B Guest Workers in\n                  2017.&rdquo; <em>CIS.org</em>, 2 Apr. 2018,\n                  cis.org/Report/Maps-Impact-H2B-Guest-Workers-2017.
